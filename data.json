It browns nicely and stays tender inside. I've added it to pasta, breakfast skillets, and even pizza, and it always elevates the flavor.\n\nIf you enjoy a little heat and rich, meaty flavor, this sausage won't disappoint.

We have Amazon devices and wanted a larger TV. We couldn't find a large Roku TV but did find a Fire TV that was 75\". We almost instantly had buyer's remorse. But we decided not to get a new TV unless we could find a Roku TV that was at least 75\".\n\nEvery few months I would check but had no luck finding one. Then, one day walking through BJ's, I saw it, a 75\" Philips Roku QLED TV! And it was on sale, more than 50% off! I took photos, went home and impatiently awaited for my husband to get home from work. I almost bought it on the spot but it definitely wouldn't fit in my vehicle. I told my husband as soon as he got home and we weighed the pros and very few cons and decided to go pick one up.\n\nIt was very easy to install on the same wall mount we had. The picture is terrific and we both love how Roku tells us all the places a show or movie is available along with the cost. That's something the Fire TV didn't do. We'll eventually upgrade the remote that came with the TV to the one you can talk into, but the remote that came with the TV does the job. \n\nWe had done some reading before picking up this QLED TV, mainly the differences between a QLED and OLED TV. We saw that the colors are more vibrant on a QLED TV but the blacks are blacker on an OLED TV. Our colors are amazing and the blacks look very black to us. \n\nOverall, we're thrilled with our new Roku TV!","nickname":"Pamela","email":"shocksherfriends@aol.com","location":"Utica, NY","device_id":"896471559758002806","bottom_line":"Yes","locale":"en_US","type":"Review","product_page_id":"P_332206","merchant_group_id":12779,"merchant_id":9794,"merchant_user_id":"shocksherfriends@aol.com","profile_id":154331795,"created_date":1747568856236,"updated_date":1747568857960,"helpful_votes":0,"not_helpful_votes":0,"review_source":"email","order_id":"5449","client_publication_status":"REJECTED","pwr_publication_status":"REJECTED","client_specific_questions":{"wheredidyoupurchase":{"type":"tag","value":{"choices":["Club","Online"],"selected":["Club"]}}},"helpful_score":2114},{"id":553505909,"submission_id":"516d6836-ac98-49e0-b29e-849e75bca5db","headline":"Quick lunch","rating":5,"comments":"#sweepstakes","nickname":"Gram gram","email":"marshaphil@aol.com","location":"Philadelphia,Pa","device_id":"614022837652628039","bottom_line":"Yes","locale":"en_US","type":"Review","product_page_id":"P_215839","merchant_group_id":12779,"merchant_id":9794,"merchant_user_id":"marshaphil@aol.com","profile_id":130941585,"created_date":1747569059165,"updated_date":1747569061287,"helpful_votes":0,"not_helpful_votes":0,"review_source":"email","order_id":"2856","client_publication_status":"REJECTED","pwr_publication_status":"REJECTED","client_specific_questions":{"wheredidyoupurchase":{"type":"tag","value":{"choices":["Club","Online"],"selected":["Club"]}}},"tags":{"pros":{"choices":["Flavorful","Non-Perishable","Good Value","Well Packaged","Easy To Prepare"],"selected":["Flavorful","Non-Perishable","Good Value","Well Packaged","Easy To Prepare"]},"describeyourself":{"choices":["Simple Tastes","Frequent Diner","Health Conscious","Chef","Foodie"],"selected":["Health Conscious"]},"bestuses":{"choices":["Anytime","Gift","Holidays","Wedding Favors","Snack","Add Flavor","Entertaining"],"selected":["Snack","Add Flavor"]}},"helpful_score":952},{"id":553505898,"submission_id":"d93998e9-81a1-46ee-8ec1-6f387f92582d","headline":"Awesome","rating":5,"comments":"Just cook it up and eat","nickname":"Shel","email":"shellyville50@gmail.com","location":"Louisville KY 40228","device_id":"149764722888714053","bottom_line":"Yes","locale":"en_US","type":"Review","product_page_id":"P_337414","merchant_group_id":12779,"merchant_id":9794,"merchant_user_id":"shellyville50@gmail.com","profile_id":154331786,"created_date":1747568795833,"updated_date":1747568797441,"helpful_votes":0,"not_helpful_votes":0,"review_source":"email","order_id":"7180","client_publication_status":"APPROVED","pwr_publication_status":"APPROVED","client_specific_questions":{"wheredidyoupurchase":{"type":"tag","value":{"choices":["Club","Online"],"selected":["Club"]}}},"tags":{"pros":{"choices":["Flavorful","Non-Perishable","Good Value","Well Packaged","Easy To Prepare"],"selected":["Flavorful","Good Value","Well Packaged","Easy To Prepare"]},"describeyourself":{"choices":["Simple Tastes","Frequent Diner","Health Conscious","Chef","Foodie"],"selected":["Simple Tastes"]},"bestuses":{"choices":["Anytime","Gift","Holidays","Wedding Favors","Snack","Add Flavor","Entertaining"],"selected":["Anytime","Snack","Add Flavor"]}},"helpful_score":1141},{"id":553505823,"submission_id":"195608d5-35cb-4f56-981a-2a6f3b69d708","headline":"Kids loved it","rating":5,"comments":"This was a great price for the double pack.
